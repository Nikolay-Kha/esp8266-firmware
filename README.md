# DeviceHive ESP8266 Firmware
Special firmware to use ESP8266 as a local web server with RESTful API and as a client of DeviceHive cloud.
This repo consists of a few parts which can be used with
other projects. Each project has dedicated readme file.

# Custom firmwares
There is a possibility to build custom firmware on top of this which sends some
notifications to DeviceHive server periodically. In pauses firmware goes to deep
sleep mode. Reimplement `custom_firmware_request()` method in
`custom_firmware.c` file with reading of some sensors data. There are
implementation for some sensors in `sources/devices` dir. Also, it is possible
to create interaction with any sensor using interface implementation modules
(`dh/i2c`, `dh/spi`, `dh/onewire` etc). See `climate` branch as an example.

# Directory content

## esp-utils
Simple utils for flashing and connecting to ESP8266.

## examples-cloud
Simple web pages with JavaScript sample of sendind and receiving commands
from device via cloud. Onewire DS18B20 examples use `0x33[SKIP ROM]` command
which means that examples work only with one currently connected device. Some
browsers (for example Firefox) block cross domen requests even for local file.
Allow temporary cross domain requests in setting or use another browser to run
examples.

Local RESTful API samples are embedded to firmware. Sources of them can be found
at firmware-src/pages directory.

## firmware-src
Sources of DeviceHive ESP8266 firmware.

## firmware-src/genbin.sh
Small utils which is written on bash and can be used on any OS. This util
creates binary firmware files from crosstool-NG binary file output.

## firmware-tests
Tests for firmware. You can find command samples in file requests.html. Each
`addtest()` instance have boolean third parameter. If this parameters is `true` it
means that command and parameters is written correctly and you can use it as
a sample.

## release
Scripts for generating binary releases.

## sdk
SDK from chip manufactor. Included in this repo to make sure that we are
using the same version of this SDK to avoid any surprises from changing APIs

## License
